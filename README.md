Fill all the necessary gaps in CNN_and_Transfer_Learning.ipynb and fit neural networks for solving the binary classification task.

Part 1:

1. Build and fit CNN with 3 convolutional layers for binary classification

2. Evaluate accuracy on test data

3. Plot the graphs for Loss(number_of_epochs) and Accuracy(number_of_epochs)

Part 2

1. Build and fit Transfer Learning model using pre-trained VGG16-model weights from keras application.

2. Do the same with one more avaliable pre-trained deep learning model from keras application, for example Xception - https://keras.io/api/applications/.

2. Evaluate accuracy on test data for p.1 and p.2

3. Plot the graphs for Loss(number_of_epochs) and Accuracy(number_of_epochs)

4. Check the performance of your model with the custom image of cat or dog (so the model will tell which class this image belongs to). Develop the function for the inference of the best algorithm.

Part 3*** Contest

(not obligatory)

Train your own classificator with the highest possible accuracy on the test data. You can use any architecture/preprocessing/postprocessing/ensembling approach you want.

One student who will achieve the best score will be awarded with 5A for the course automatically!

NB: you can do the task using torch framework if it more convenient for you
